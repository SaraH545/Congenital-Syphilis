# Congenital-Syphilis
#My research question for my final data analysis is "What is the association between incidence of congenital syphilis across Louisiana counties and County Health Outcome Rankings for 2015?" 
#The data for this analysis is compiled from AtlasPlus (NCHHSTP) and countyhealthrankings.org.
#This analysis is completed by computing statistical significance through t-tests and a Spearman correlation test.
